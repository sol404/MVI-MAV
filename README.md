# MVI/MAV: A Protocol for Verifiable Semantic Interoperability for Intelligent Agents

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

**MVI/MAV (Machine Verifiable Inference/Interlingua & MVI Automated Validator)** is an architecture I'm proposing to address the complex problem of *verifiable* semantic interoperability between intelligent agents. The goal is to ensure that the meaning and logical coherence of exchanged information can be automatically validated, thereby aiming to establish a basis of trust in multi-AI ecosystems.

This project is currently at the **concept/proposal stage**, and I am actively seeking feedback and technical opinions to refine the idea!

## The Problem Addressed

Semantic interoperability – ensuring that different agents interpret exchanged information in the same way – is a persistent and critical challenge in multi-agent AI. Misunderstandings can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and a lack of reliability in autonomous collaborations. Furthermore, how can this shared understanding be *verified*?

## My Proposal: MVI/MAV

MVI/MAV consists of two main components:

1.  **MVI (Machine Verifiable Interlingua)**:
    * A symbolic language structured using **S-expressions** (similar to LISP or KIF).
    * Serves as an **interlingua** (pivot language) for agents to express concepts (states, actions, beliefs, relations) unambiguously.
    * It defines a set of predefined fundamental **semantic primitives**:
        * `ACT:` (action)
        * `ENTITY:` (entity)
        * `REL:` (relation)
        * `MOD:` (modifier)
        * `META:` (mental states/intentions)
        * `QUANT:` (quantifier)
    * Example: `(ACT: execute (ENTITY:task A))`
    * It relies on **Shared Semantic Resources** (conceptually JSON files) for its precision:
        * `MSOS (Minimal Shared Ontology Seed)`: Core primitives.
        * `Alias Seed`: Manages synonyms.
        * `Relation Lattice`: Hierarchical relationships (sub-types/super-types) for `REL:`.
        * `Modifier Clusters`: Groupings of semantically similar modifiers for `MOD:`.

2.  **MAV (MVI Automated Validator)**:
    * An **automated validator** that parses, normalizes, compares, and validates MVI expressions.
    * It uses the shared semantic resources to inform its analysis.
    * It applies specific heuristic **difference resolution logics (P1, P2, P3)** to assess and potentially 'downgrade' the severity of detected semantic differences:
        * **P1** (for `MOD:`): Uses *Modifier Clusters*. Can "downgrade" a difference (e.g., FAIL -> WARN) if modifiers belong to the same cluster.
        * **P2** (for `REL:`): Uses the *Relation Lattice*. Can downgrade if one relation is a sub/super-type of another.
        * **P3** (for `META:`): Specific logic for analyzing nested structures related to mental states.
    * Operates in **strict** (no degradation) or **lenient-symbolic** (P1 & P2 active) modes.
    * Generates a **structured validation report** (conceptually JSON) indicating:
        * Overall verdict: `PASS`, `WARN`, ou `FAIL`.
        * Detailed list of differences (type, severity, location, downgrade reason, proximity hint).

## Context and Existing Approaches

MVI/MAV is not being developed in a vacuum. The challenge of semantic interoperability has been addressed by various approaches, including:

* **Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) / Common Logic (ISO/IEC 24707):** These are S-expression based (like MVI) and focus on formal logic for knowledge representation and interchange. They provide a strong foundation for logical inference but can be complex. MVI shares the S-expression syntax, but MAV's validation is heuristic and built-in, rather than relying solely on general-purpose logical provers.
* **FIPA ACL (Agent Communication Language) & Semantic Web Technologies (OWL/RDF):** FIPA ACL is a widely recognized standard for agent communication acts (speech acts, BDI concepts). It often uses rich, formal ontologies expressed in OWL/RDF for content semantics, enabling powerful reasoning capabilities via external reasoners. This offers significant expressive power and standardization but can introduce complexity in implementation, ontology management, and end-to-end semantic verification. MVI/MAV aims for a more tightly coupled language-validator system with simpler, JSON-based semantic resources, potentially trading some formal expressiveness for more straightforward, built-in validation tailored to its primitives.
* **Modern Agent Protocols (e.g., Google's Agent2Agent (A2A), W3C AI Agent Protocol initiatives):** These often focus on practical interoperability at the task and capability level, leveraging standard web technologies (JSON-RPC, HTTP, etc.). A2A emphasizes opaque agent execution, while the W3C community group is exploring standardized metadata, identity, and verifiable credentials. MVI/MAV is more deeply focused on the *semantic content* of messages and its verifiable coherence within its specific framework. It could potentially serve as a verifiable content language within such broader protocol frameworks if its specific validation mechanisms are deemed beneficial.

MVI/MAV attempts to find a niche by providing an integrated, explicit semantic validation mechanism (MAV) for its MVI language, featuring defined (though heuristic) logic for handling semantic variances. The aim is to offer a pragmatic balance for certain types of multi-agent systems where this specific kind of verifiable communication is key.

## Why MVI/MAV? What's Unique (Revisited in Context)?

Given the existing landscape, the specific value I hope MVI/MAV can offer lies in:

* **Integrated and Explicit Validation**: Unlike approaches where content validation is often external or ad-hoc, MAV is designed specifically for MVI.
* **Defined Semantic Difference Degradation (P1-P3)**: This heuristic-based logic offers a pragmatic way to manage partial semantic matches or acceptable variations within the MVI framework, providing controlled flexibility.
* **Structured and Traceable Reports**: The detailed JSON report aims to make semantic (mis)alignments explicit and debuggable.
* **Relative Simplicity of Semantic Resources**: The JSON-based approach for MSOS, Lattices, and Clusters is intended to lower the adoption barrier for defining shared semantics in contexts where full OWL/RDF expressivity might be overkill or too complex to manage for the specific validation task at hand.
* **Focus on "Verifiability" (within its scope)**: The core goal is machine-verifiable semantic interpretation *as defined by MAV's rules and resources*. This means ensuring coherence and consistency according to the MVI/MAV framework, rather than necessarily full formal logical proof against arbitrary external ontologies.

## Current Project Status

MVI/MAV is currently an **idea under development**. There is no reference implementation yet. This repository serves to document the concept and solicit feedback.

## Call for Feedback and Discussion!

I believe MVI/MAV offers an interesting perspective on an important problem, but I'm keenly aware of the challenges and the rich history of existing work. Your expertise and feedback are invaluable!

I'd particularly appreciate your thoughts on:

* The **novelty and relevance** of the MVI/MAV approach, especially when compared to the alternatives mentioned above.
* The **robustness and utility** of MAV's heuristic validation logic (P1-P3).
* The trade-offs of using **JSON-based semantic resources** versus more formal ontologies.
* The clarity and scope of the term **"verifiable inference"** in this context.
* Potential **use cases** where MVI/MAV might find a suitable niche.
* **Interoperability challenges and strategies** for MVI/MAV agents needing to communicate with systems using other standards.
* Suggestions for **improving, evolving, or evaluating** the protocol.
